UAV Strategic De-confliction in Share Airspace.
-
This projects can be used to decide if the routes of UAV conflict with each other or not if so where and which route conflict.
The Conflict detection system ensures both temporal and spatial check of the routes for any conflicts.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Download the folder or clone it
2. make sure you have python installed
3. Set up the environment in the folder and install the requirements using pip
4. Run the main.py file.
the code will first check the schedule for any conflicts and if it finds no conflicts it will start the simulation and the animation of the drone
 you can find the logs generated by the Conflict_Detector.py in the logs.txt file

CHANGEABLE PARAMETERS:

- schedule file location - main.py(fileName)
- Disable/enable route visualization - main.py (drawRoute)
- Minimum buffer distance - conflict_detector.py (MIN_DISTANCE)
- log file location - conflict_detector.py (logFile)
- colors of routes - simulator.py (self.color)

SCHEDULE FORMAT:
- you can add more docks and drones, 1 dock for each drone. the routes are assigned in order
- ensure there is enough distance between the docks, to avoid conflicts
- in the routes the end_time should be slightly greater than the estimated end time
- the waypoint contains the next destination of the drone (x, y, z, t) the drone will wait at this location for 't' seconds
- the first and last waypoint of the route should always be the same as the dock position
